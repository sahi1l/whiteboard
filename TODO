4. Add a grid and snapping (maybe).
5. Add a text tool.
6. Add rectangle tool?
9. Undo could keep track of when each stroke was made, and then save it as a movie?
10. Size of canvases should be automatic (but aspect ratio maintained) based on window size.
    - Actually resize all the elements, use the scale command
13. Delete page (with confirmation)
14. Add confirmation to Clear.
15. More spacing between buttons
17. cursor and pointer are redundant
18. Dashed lines ":Dashed" the note says
20. Add text "Page x of X" to palette
21. Allow for a second window which mirrors the first but without the palette, that can be used with a second screen.
22. Remove the points that accompany each line.
23. I already can do straight lines, but hold down a button to see the phantom line that I am potentially drawing.  Hold down shift to snap to vertical or horizontal.
24. Create a fork that removes all the paging and saving aspects (and pointer), makes the page size more variable and adjustable, but keeps the clipboard. It can be a quick doodler for Keynote and such.
