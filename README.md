This is an electronic whiteboard I use to teach my college courses.
It includes a second screen which mirrors the writing surface which
you can put on a separate monitor or projector for display.  It also
generates PDFs of its contents with the right size and aspect ratio
for printing.

This is alpha software and currently designed around my own usage,
although I plan on making it more suitable for a general audience in
the next few months.

To run it (for now), you must have Tcl/Tk 8.6 installed.  From the
command line, type
    wish AppMain.tcl
from this directory.
